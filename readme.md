KaraQuests

KaraQuests is a web application that allows you to store a database of your songs that users can then use to search through and add songs they wish to sing to a playlist.

This project was first made with the intention to work with UltraStar and another project USIndexer which creates a CSV which lists all the songs that you have which can be imported so you don't have to type in every entry. But it is very generic.
